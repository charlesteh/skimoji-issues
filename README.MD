If you've owned a Windows 3.0 desktop computer before, chances are you've tried Microsoft SkiFree! Skimoji is a less than faithful recreation of SkiFree, using emojis! **[Play Skimoji here](https://skimoji.charlesteh.io/)**

## Why I made this

I grew up playing retro computer games and I really enjoyed the mechanics of SkiFree.

Also, I wanted to have mobile support because skiing on your phone while on the toilet is peak 2025.

## Why emojis?

Prior to making Skimoji, I played the original SkiFree and got curious to see if Claude could figure out a clone in React. It started to produce an emoji version of the game. I thought, why not make it for real?

It wasn't straightforward though, if you look closely at the Skier (when facing front) they are built using ü•¢ and üßç. The Snow Monster is made with üëπ and ‚òÉÔ∏è

You'd also be surprised to know that Windows OS is relatively backward in emoji supports. For example, I had to use a üóø instead of a rock because Windows does not have a rock emoji but MacOS does.

I've yet to try it out in Linux or other OS-es. If there's a missing emoji, please report in [Issues](https://github.com/charlesteh/skimoji-issues/issues).

## Did you vibe this out?

Yes and No. While Claude gave a foundation, I still had to piece together the entire puzzle. Claude is definitely helpful here, figuring out the physics, world and other important mechanics that made it possible.

## Pfft, this game is not close to SkiFree at all

Of course, that's why it's called Skimoji, not a Skifree clone. However, I do have some interest in trying to get some of the original features into Skimoji, such as "The Dog", "The Chair Lift", "The Moving Tree" (sorry I don't know the official names)

Some Skimoji features are also not in the original SkiFree, and that's intentional. If you have a problem with it, feel free to your own clone with Claude or ChatGPT. I made this because I want to play it on a phone.

BTW, there's already an ongoing recreation of SkiFree called [SkiFree JS](https://github.com/basicallydan/skifree.js/), you can try it there.

## Found a bug?

Check if someone already reported it in [Issues](https://github.com/charlesteh/skimoji-issues/issues), and if not, make a new one. Read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.MD) first. This is a solo project, so be patient!

## Want a new feature?

Sure, tell me about it in [Issues](https://github.com/charlesteh/skimoji-issues/issues). I can't promise I'll add everything (I have a job), but I love hearing ideas. Especially if you have good emoji suggestions for new obstacles.
