Hey! Thanks for wanting to help make this silly emoji skiing game better.

## What you can do

**Report bugs** - If something's broken, let me know  
**Suggest features** - Got a cool idea? I want to hear it  
**Share feedback** - Tell me what feels good or sucks about the game  

## Reporting bugs

Before making a new issue, quickly check if someone already reported the same thing. If not, here's what helps me fix stuff:

**Tell me:**

-   What device/browser you're using
-   What you were doing when it broke
-   What you expected vs what actually happened
-   Screenshots if it's a visual thing

**Example of a good bug report:**

> Playing on iPhone Safari. The jump button stopped working after I hit the boost. Expected to jump over the tree, but my skier just slammed into it like an idiot. Happened twice in a row.

**Example of a less helpful bug report:**

> Game broken fix pls

## Feature requests

I love hearing new ideas, especially:

-   New emoji obstacles (got a good one? tell me!)
-   Power-up ideas
-   Ways to make the snow monster more interesting/terrifying
-   Mobile improvements
-   Anything that would make you play more

Just remember I'm one person with limited time, so I can't add everything. But ideas are always welcome.

## A few guidelines

**Do:**

-   Be nice to people
-   Actually play the game before reporting stuff
-   Give me enough info to understand/reproduce issues

**Don't:**

-   Be a jerk
-   Spam the same issue multiple times
-   Ask for the source code (it's messy and I'm embarrassed)
-   Expect instant responses (I have a life... sort of)

## Labels I use

-   `bug` - Something's broken
-   `enhancement` - New feature idea
-   `mobile` - Phone/tablet specific stuff
-   `snow-monster` - Yeti-related issues
-   `help wanted` - I'm stuck and need ideas
-   `emoji` - Emoji-related issues


## Mobile testing

If you're reporting mobile issues, it helps to know:

-   Portrait vs landscape mode
-   What happens when you rotate the screen
-   If the virtual controls feel responsive
-   Whether it gets laggy during long sessions
